This is a GUI Tic-Tac-Toe game I implemented when I was in UR. 
I also implemeted the AI for this game with a pretty high difficulty so it is very hard for user to win. There is also an JOptionPane which pops out with the highscore table. I created a file called "Winningrecord.txt" and it should store 0,0,0, now which is the three number for the amount of user wins, computer wins and draws. I use Scanner class to import the three numbers of the file into the program and put them in the message shown on the JOptionPane. Before the program exits, the new record will be written into the "Winningrecord.txt"using Formatter. 


3.Instructions on how to run the programs
First you have to make sure there is a R.png file and a Winningrecord.txt file in the same location as the source code/jar file.

Just press on the jar file, it will run.

For source code, go to terminal and locate the files first, then:
javac TicTacToe.java
java TicTacToe
